Slanguage will scan webpages for slang text and will add them to your inbox with the definitions. Easy and simple!

SSUI Assignment #7 Writeup
Norman Kang

Part 1:
Last month, I participated in a design hackathon. My team (Ketaki Rao, Ben Stone and I) designed a chrome extension called Slanguage. The purpose of the extension is to translate slang or colloquial language to formal english. This is meant to help foreigners who come to the United States and know formal english but do not know casual speaking terms and phrases. The extension will scan the text on a web page and find the slang terminology and translate them from a database. This is easy to use as you would just install the extension and check the inbox when you want to.

Part 2:
The interaction is a web based chrome extension.
The extension will add found words/phrases into the slanguage inbox.
When the user clicks on the slanguage chrome extension icon, a box will appear with all the found slang terminology and the definitions.
The user can remove words by clicking the check mark next to the slang words.
Google search slang words such as “lit”, “dood”, “goat” and more.

Part 3:
I used a chrome extension to build Slanguage. The most difficult part was learning how to link the different javascript pages such as background.js, content.js and popup.js in a seamless way. I was not aware of what each javascript page was responsible for so it was a good learning experience for me to create all three. I used popup.js to handle the javascript that needed to run when the icon was clicked and background.js/content.js to handle javascript that should run on webpages. The last part was allowing message handling between the pages.

Part 4:
I iterated on assignment 7 in a large way. In fact, I changed my whole project. This was because after the design hackathon, I felt like it would be a great coding challenge to create the design we had made. I wanted to allow the ideas to come full circle and become an actual usable piece of software.

Part 5:
The largest challenge was handling messages between the javascript pages. This was new to me, so I had to read a lot of documentation on how to accomplish this. Turns out, it is not so complicated! This is the cycle of most coding experiences that I have.
